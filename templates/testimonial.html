				                                    <p>I already given a <strong>5-star rating</strong>, but I also wanted to provide my two cents in case anyone is unsure about purchasing this theme. Not only is the theme itself very versatile and easy to manipulate, but the support we get in the forum is amazing – the developers are very, very quick to respond to issues. It’s a great theme and I would strongly recommend it.</p>

				                                    <p>What to say about the Maya theme? THANK YOU !! THANK YOU !! I recently purchased the wonderful Maya theme and although I’m still learning it, I am already beyond thrilled with it! I’m not a developer, I don’t know any code, yet, I’m positive I can build a gorgeous website!</p>
				                                    <p>I’ve previously used another wp-theme for my business site that is attractive on the “outside”, but the instructions have been a nightmare from day 1. As I’m unable to do some of the work myself, I’ve hired multiple designers to work on my site. Once they saw the admin. area and the instructions, they didn’t want to waste their time trying to plod through the confusing directions, so wouldn’t work on my site. Not so with the Maya theme! The instructions and even the coding is clean, efficient, organized and very easy to understand! A HUGE difference from my other mess.</p>
				                                    <p>The support has been prompt and efficient (could I expect anything less from this wonderful team?) Yesterday I saw a notification in my wp-admin that the theme had an update. What a pleasure! My old theme developer requires that you, as the subscriber, constantly check to see if there are any updates! As if a small business owner has nothing else to do! The only “negative” comment I have (joking) is that I could only give 5 Stars!!</p>
				                                    <p>This team deserves much more than 5! I wish this wonderful design team MUCH success! Thank you, Mimi</p>
